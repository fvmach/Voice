Welcome to the Owl Bank Help Center. I’m Olli, your AI assistant. I’m available anytime to answer your questions and help you with banking, investments, credit, and more.

Let’s go through some of the most common questions I get.

First, banking services.

If you want to open an account, the process is fully digital and takes less than five minutes.  
We don’t charge any monthly maintenance fees, and there are no hidden costs.  
You can deposit money through Pix, bank transfers, boletos, or direct deposits.  
And I’ll keep an eye on your spending, bills, and subscriptions to help you stay in control.

Now let’s talk about investments.

You can invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, CDBs, LCIs, crypto, and ESG-focused portfolios.  
You can start small — even with just one real — thanks to fractional investing.  
Our robo-advisor can build and adjust a personalized strategy for you automatically.  
There’s no fee for basic investment accounts, and our AI-managed portfolios cost zero point five percent per year.

Next up, credit products.

You can apply for credit instantly through the Owl Bank app.  
Approval happens in seconds, powered by AI.  
There’s no annual fee, and your credit limit adjusts based on your behavior.  
If you ever miss a payment, our system can offer extensions, restructuring plans, and personalized guidance.

Let’s move on to insurance.

We offer insurance for your car, life, travel, devices, and your home — all with smart integration for connected devices.  
Rates are personalized in real time using AI.  
If something happens, you can file a claim instantly, and simple cases are approved automatically.

For high-value clients, we offer private wealth services.

This includes access to private banking, alternative investments, and estate planning.  
Human advisors are always available on demand.  
Meanwhile, our AI continuously optimizes your portfolio based on real-time market data.

We also offer financial coaching tools.

You can set savings goals, plan your income, track your bills, and negotiate debt.  
Our AI can help you improve your credit score.  
And if you’re in debt, I can help you negotiate better terms and settlement strategies.

Finally, security and fraud protection.

We monitor your account in real time and block suspicious activity immediately.  
If needed, I can help you lock your account, freeze your card, and recover access.  
Your account is protected with biometric security like face ID, fingerprints, or voice recognition.

You can always reach Owl Bank through the app chat, by email at support at owlbank dot AI, or by phone at plus fifty five, eleven, fifty twenty-six, sixty-six nineteen.
