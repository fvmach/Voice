# Voice Agent Improvements Summary

## Issues Identified from the Transcript

Based on the longer test transcript, several behavioral issues were identified:

1. **Banking balance returning wrong information** - The agent wasn't providing correct account balance data
2. **Long product lists without discovery questions** - The agent was overwhelming customers with multiple investment options at once
3. **Missing step-by-step confirmation** - The agent provided multiple steps without asking if the customer wanted to proceed step-by-step

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ 1. Fixed Banking Balance Issue

**Problem**: Banking tools were failing due to missing `requests` dependency and incorrect user ID handling.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `tools/banking_tools.py` to use Python's standard library (`urllib`) instead of external dependencies
- Enhanced user ID normalization to properly handle `client:email@domain.com` format from Conversation Relay
- Now correctly extracts `owl.anunes@gmail.com` from `client:owl.anunes@gmail.com`

**Results**:
- ✅ Banking balance now returns correct data: R$ 9,500.00
- ✅ Credit debt: R$ 3,500.00  
- ✅ Loyalty points: 42,000

### ✅ 2. Enhanced Agent Behavioral Instructions

**Problem**: Agent was providing long lists of products and overwhelming customers.

**Solution**: Updated the `build_agent_context()` function in `server.py` to include critical behavioral rules:

```
- Never read out long lists of products or recommendations. Ask discovery questions first to narrow options.
- Ask ONE question at a time and wait for the customer's reply.
- Before a multistep task, ask: do they prefer step-by-step with confirmation at each step, or a summary of all steps? Default to step-by-step.
- Confirm understanding and get consent before moving to the next step.
- Keep utterances concise and optimized for TTS; avoid emojis and special characters.
```

### ✅ 3. Product Discovery System

**Problem**: No structured approach to understand customer needs before making recommendations.

**Solution**: Created `tools/product_discovery.py` with structured discovery questions for:

**Investments:**
- Experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive) 
- Investment timeframe (short, medium, long term)
- Investment goals (emergency fund, retirement, etc.)

**Loans:**
- Loan purpose
- Required amount
- Repayment preferences

**Credit Cards:**
- Usage patterns
- Benefits preferences (cashback, miles, low fees)

### ✅ 4. Step-by-Step Guidance System

**Problem**: Agent provided multiple steps at once without confirmation.

**Solution**: 
- Added automatic preference detection for step-by-step vs summary approach
- Agent now asks customers: "Do you prefer step-by-step with confirmation, or a summary of all steps?"
- Default behavior is step-by-step with confirmation at each stage

## Expected Behavioral Changes

With these improvements, the voice agent will now:

1. **Ask for banking info first**: "What's your account balance?" → Correctly returns R$ 9,500.00
2. **Use discovery questions**: "I want to invest" → "Are you a beginner or have you invested before?"
3. **Confirm step preferences**: "Help me invest" → "Would you prefer step-by-step guidance or a summary?"
4. **One question at a time**: Instead of listing 5 investment options, asks targeted questions to narrow down
5. **Wait for confirmation**: Before moving to next step, confirms customer is ready

## Integration Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No external dependencies added (removed `requests` dependency)
- Banking tools work with existing phone number formats from Conversation Relay
- Behavioral instructions are applied to all agents (Olli, Sunny, Max, Io)

## Testing

- ✅ Banking API integration tested and working
- ✅ User ID normalization handles `client:email@domain.com` format correctly
- ✅ Product discovery questions cover major banking categories
- ✅ Behavioral instructions integrated into agent context

The voice agent should now provide a much better customer experience with personalized, step-by-step guidance and accurate banking information.
