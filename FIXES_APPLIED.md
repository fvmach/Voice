# Conversation Agent Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Route_to Commands Being Vocalized
**Problem**: `#route_to:AgentName` commands were appearing in TTS output  
**Solution**: 
- Changed streaming approach to collect full response before sending to TTS
- Clean `#route_to:` commands from response before streaming to customer
- Added word-by-word streaming of cleaned response

### 2. ✅ Incorrect Agent Routing  
**Problem**: Customer asked about investments but was routed to Sunny (onboarding) instead of Io (investments)  
**Solution**:
- Updated `route-to-specialist.json` with broader investment triggers
- Added triggers like "Investment options", "Low-risk strategies", "Where to invest money"

### 3. ✅ Agent Identity Confusion
**Problem**: Agents saying wrong names (Sunny saying "here is Max")  
**Solution**:
- Added agent-specific personality map in `build_agent_context()`
- Added explicit identity instructions: "Always identify yourself correctly as {agent.name}"
- Clear personality definitions for each agent

### 4. ✅ Context Loss During Agent Switches
**Problem**: New agents didn't remember previous conversation  
**Solution**:
- Added context transfer message when switching agents
- Preserves chat history across agent switches
- New agent gets informed about the transfer context

### 5. ✅ Banking API Integration
**Problem**: Banking API wasn't working  
**Solution**:
- Fixed API call from POST to GET request
- Updated endpoint to match working URL format
- Fixed response parsing for balance, creditDebt, loyaltyPoints

## Files Modified

1. `Signal SP Session/server.py` - Main server logic
2. `Signal SP Session/tools/banking_tools.py` - Banking API integration  
3. `Signal SP Session/tools/route-to-specialist.json` - Agent routing triggers
4. `start-advanced-server.sh` - Server startup script

## How to Test

1. Start the advanced server: `./start-advanced-server.sh`
2. Test scenarios:
   - Ask about investments → should route to Io
   - Ask about account setup → should route to Sunny  
   - Ask about wealth management → should route to Max
   - Ask about balance → should use banking API
   - Verify no `#route_to:` commands are spoken
   - Verify agents identify themselves correctly
   - Verify context is preserved during switches

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ No routing commands in TTS output
- ✅ Correct agent routing based on customer intent
- ✅ Agents identify themselves properly  
- ✅ Context preserved during agent switches
- ✅ Banking API working with real data
